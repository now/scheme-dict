\title{Scheme-dict ReadMe}

\section{Introduction}

Scheme-dict is an implementation of the \DICT\ dictionary protocol.  It
includes both a set of modules for dealing with \MDFIVE\ checksums,
destructuring of lists, and the \DICT\ protocol itself, as well as a client
program that can be used to connect to a \DICT\ server and retrieve dictionary
definitions for words using the methods available at the server.  The client
program provides additional information on how to use it.
